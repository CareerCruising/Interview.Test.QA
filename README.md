We are assuming you are familar with github. If you need help with running the website locally, give us a shout and we would be happy to assist.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.1.

## Local Node Environment

Angular needs Node.js. Go to nodejs.org and download the latest version of Node.js

## Angular CLI

To set up, open the command prompt. Navigate to where the code is located. For example if you downloaded the code to C:\workspace\Interview.Test.QA, type:

cd C:\workspace\Interview.Test.QA

Next, run the following command:

npm install

## Running the site locally
In the same command window run the command:

npm start

The website will launch in your default browser with the url http://localhost:4200/


### What you need to do:
* Fork this repo
* Assuming you have successfully set up the front end repository which you will use to write E2E tests:
* Set yourself up with the automation framework of your choice. (We are using Cypress for our E2E testing)
* Add a folder with your name under AutomatedQAScripts, and that will be your working space during the interview.
* You are free to set up the structure of the test suite under "AutomatedQAScripts" before coming to the interview discussion.
* During the discussion, you will be asked to write an E2E test for a specific scenario.
* At the end of discussion, you should create a branch in Github and push your changes to Github.
