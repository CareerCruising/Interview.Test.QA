# QA Interview Scripts


In order to run this suite:

1. Clone the repository, go to Automated QA Scripts folder
2. Do `npm install` in the project folder, to install all dependencies
3. To run the test, in the terminal of the project folder run `npm test`

To complete this assignment, I have used WebdriverIO with Mocha framework.
For assertion, a library called chaijs is also used.
